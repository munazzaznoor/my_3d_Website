# my_3d_Website

I have created this website as a learning tool for myself to understand the concept of building 3D websites using three.js. While it is not currently ready for users, I am working on building my 3D website portfolio and will be adding it to the site in the near future. In the meantime, please feel free to browse through the screenshots and watch the accompanying video to see the results of my code. Thank you for visiting!
